Platinum Core - South Africa

Platinum Core is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin. Platinum Core has a rapidly changing Proof of Work and Proof of Stake system, and it's first goal is to test an evolving POS system and observe it's effects on the blockchain and in the altcoin marketplace.

Platinum Core is built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin, Novacoin, and BitcoinDark, with a modified POS system.

We are testing also a new strategy where there is no block halving but instead we kick off with a low reward system which rapidly increase as the number of blocks get mined. This will hopefully settle in at a good market price for future trades. It's goal is also to encourage miners to get higher rewards as the number of blocks increase.

There will be a 1 % premine - premine goes towards Developer for Bounties, Donations, Giveawys & Future development of the coin.
